# Employee-Turnover-Prediction-with-Random-Forest-

## Overview
The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that predicts whether an employee will leave the company
based on their job title, department, number of projects, average monthly hours, and any other relevant data points. A
good model will help the company increase retention and job satisfaction for current employees, and save money and time 
training new employees.
