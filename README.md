# Employee-Turnover-Prediction-with-Random-Forest-

## Overview
The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that predicts whether an employee will leave the company
based on their job title, department, number of projects, average monthly hours, and any other relevant data points. This 
project utilized Salifort Motors employee data. The final random forest model performed with 96% accuracy 
and 87% precision. Based on the model, the last evaluation score, number of projects, tenure  and being overworked were the most influential
in determining the departure of an employee.

## Business Undertanding
A well-designed model will enable the company to enhance employee retention and job satisfaction, while also reducing the costs and time associated
with training new hires. By identifying the factors that influence employee departures, Salifort Motors can take proactive and corrective measures to 
address these issues.

## Data Understanding

The data for this project comprised 11 991 rows representing individual employees, and 10 columns, of which 9 are features. These features included 
details such as satisfaction level, the number of projects an employee contributes to, the average number of hours worked per month, and additional 
relevant information. Out of the 11 991 employees, approximately 83.4% stayed and 16.6% left. 

Some features were engineered and dropped.
